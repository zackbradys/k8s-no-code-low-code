## Our Problem Statement
The U.S. Government is consistenly faced with the ever-increasing problem of the lack resources to perform their vital missions. In search of simplicity and speed of development, government organizations, military branches, and contracting companies are shifting more of their application development to low-code and no-code platforms. However, the low-code/no-code framework comes with many drawbacks that are difficult to overcome. It's limitations with functionality, capabilities, scalability, and security leads organizations to leverage a different modernization approach within containerization and microservice development. In this whitepaper, we will expand on the benefits and drawbacks of each modernization methodology and how the pairing and marraige between no-code/low-code and containerization/kubernetes can empower development teams to be successful in their missions.

## Analysis of Low-Code/No-Code

### Benefits of Low-Code/No-Code:
* Intuitive development environment with drag-and-drop features make developing simple applications faster and easier.
* Pre-built frameworks and templates fast-track design for a set of application types.
* Newly trained developers can offload simple projects from Infrastructure and DevSecOps teams.

### Drawbacks of Low-Code/No-Code:
* Pre-defined templates and processors limit the functionality and end-user experience.
* Complex use cases and applications require flexibility, scalability and customization that are not possible within the confines of low-code, no-code templates and processors.
* Presents a security risk as scanning the source code for pre-built processors is difficult, if not blocked entirely.
* Presents limitations and uncertainty around upgrades, improvements and new functionality that your organization may want to implement.

### Use Cases of Low-Code/No-Code:
* Simplified UI design â€“ Low-code and no-code platforms can be used to quickly develop cross-device and cross-platform user interfaces, even if the functions or workloads are powered by third-party tools.
* Small and well-defined transactional systems.
* Tools that are developed for simple workloads such as HR performance reviews, employee surveys, or reserving a time and location for an appointment.
