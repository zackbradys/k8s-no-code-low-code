# The Intersection of Low-Code/No-Code and Containerization/Kubernetes

**Authored by Zack Brady and Kevin Pence**

*Featuring GovCIO and DLT Solutions*


## Our Problem Statement:
The Government is faced with an ever-increasing problem of not enough resources to perform missions as needed. The use of automated bots and scripts is on the brink of becoming mainstream with the USG,
In search of simplicity and speed of development, government organizations and contracting companies are shifting more of their application development to low-code and no-code platforms. However, the low-code/no-code framework comes with many drawbacks that are difficult to overcome. Limitations within functionality, scalability, and security leads organizations to leverage a different modernization approach within containerization, kubernetes, and microservice development. In this whitepaper, we will expand on the benefits and drawbacks of each modernization methodology and how the pairing between no-code/no-code and containerization/kubernetes can empower development teams to be successful.

## Analysis of Low-Code/No-Code

### Benefits of Low-Code/No-Code:
Intuitive IDE with drag-and-drop features make developing simple applications faster and easier.
Pre-built templates fast-track design for a set of application types.
Newly trained citizen developers can offload simple projects from IT and DevOps teams.

### Drawbacks of Low-Code/No-Code:
Pre-defined templates and processors limit the functionality and end-user experience
Complex use cases and applications require flexibility, scalability and customization that are not possible within the confines of low-code, no-code templates and processors.
Presents a security risk as scanning the source code for pre-built processors is difficult, if not blocked entirely.
Presents limitations and uncertainty around upgrades, improvements and new functionality that your organization may want to implement.

### Use Cases of Low-Code/No-Code:
Simplified UI design â€“ Low-code and no-code platforms can be used to quickly develop cross-device and cross-platform user interfaces, even if the functions or workloads are powered by third-party tools.
Small and well-defined transactional systems.  Tools that are developed for simple workloads such as HR performance reviews, employee surveys, or reserving a time and location for an appointment.
